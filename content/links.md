**So you want to DevOps?** _There's no "right" path, but here's my path._

## Learn to Code at the Commandline

---

> _Automation is the language of the sysadmin. Embrace the keyboard. Code away what's trivial, boring, mundane, and belittling_

## Store Your Code in Source Control

## Infrastructure Should be Code

---

> Because clicking sucks.

## Releasing Code Can't be Manual

---

> You've automated the sysadmin stuff. Now automate some more. It's time to automate the build, deployment, and testing of your automation.

## Cloud,   `Insert Something clever`

---

> The industry is rebasing on a new skill set. And that skill set is cloud.

**Reading List**

1. [Practice of Cloud System Administration, The: DevOps and SRE Practices for Web Services, Volume 2](https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Cloud-System-Administration-Practices/dp/032194318X)
2. [Cloud Native Patterns](https://www.manning.com/books/cloud-native-patterns)

**Level Up with Certs**

Certifications matter. Each major cloud vendor has made a tremendous investment in their certification tracks. It’s simple, they want you to be able to use their cloud. 

If you feel stuck. Or left behind in the cloud game, study, and crush some exams. It’s not the piece of paper that matters. It won’t make you an expert. But it will get you in the game and you’ll have something to show for it. 

In other words, [certifications don’t matter but they absolutely do matter](https://duffney.io/certifications-dont-matter-but-they-absolutely-do-matter/).

AWS

1. [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)
2. [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
3. [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/)

[Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-administrator)
[Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/devops-engineer)

_I have a sysadmin background. And my recommendations reflect my background. I hold the AWS CCP, but then chose to pivot to Azure. I currently hold the AZ-103 & AZ-400._
