_How do high performers output so much?_ 🤔

## Reflection

**1**.

Compulsory consumption of input is an illusion of productivity. Only through your output do you test the knowledge you’ve acquired. Optimizing your outputs means building systems where one good input creates many outputs.

## Action

**1**.

Optimize output by minimizing input, but start by balancing the two.

I am obsessed with productivity.

At times, it’s not a healthy obsession. Often I’ll allow my competitive nature to take over and I begin to compete with those I admire and immediately jump into trying to replicate their level of output. If I keep that up for too long, I burn out.

It’s a big part of the reason I’m on a 30 day digital fast.

Turning off has made me realize I don’t have a system that supports the same level of output as say, James Clear.

My biggest constraint is I write slowly.

So, I’m building a system that allows me to write fast by intentionally balancing my input and output. I’m doing that by creating PACTs2 with myself and establishing daily habits that support my goals. Here’s what I’ve got so far.

**Output Goals**

* Publish 3 tweets per day
* Write 1 newsletter per week
* Publish 1 freelance article per month
* Write 2 essays per month
* Publish 1 book per year

**Daily Habits** 👈 (Balance input and output)

* Write 2 hours per day -> Doable
* Read 2 hours per day -> Failed horribly, 30-45 min is achievable

What’s your input to output ratio?

Until next time,
