title: Seek Variety in the Grind
---

As I feel the symptoms of burnout encroaching on my mind, I pause. 

I’ve found my limits again, or at least something close to them anyway. 

It isn’t the pace I’m going. I do not feel tired or exhausted. My mind feels dull. As perhaps a factory worker feels after a long day of work, repeating the same task over and over again without the slightest variation. 

That’s it, variation! Perhaps the answer lies within variety, variety in the grind. But before that search begins, rest I must.
