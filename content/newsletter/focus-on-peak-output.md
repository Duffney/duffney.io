## Reflection

**1**.

Growth generates desire when it’s an outcome. When it’s pushed aside, it becomes a side-effect. Focus on the process instead of the outcome and growth will become a natural consequence of your actions.

## Quote

**1**.

> _“The world doesn’t reward your average, it rewards great works.” - @naval_

The lesson I learned from this was, examine my desires.

Desires are chosen unhappiness.

When you choose to set a monetary goal for your career, you’re choosing to be unhappy until you achieve it. I’m learning to examine my desires and to question their existence.

Often I realize they don’t matter and I shouldn’t pursue them.

Reserve your desire for what truly matters.

## Action

**1**.

Write a letter.

On your climb to who you want to be, it’s easy to forget who helped you get there.

Pause for a moment and ask “Who helped me get here?”. If you’re thinking about it deep enough, you’ll realize it’s quite a list.

Take a stroll down memory lane and write just one of them a letter.

Let them know what you remember and how they’ve helped shape who you are. I’ve written several of these letters, one to my grandfather and a few to my wife.

You won’t regret writing them, but I assure you, you will regret not writing them.

Until next time,

Josh Duffney
