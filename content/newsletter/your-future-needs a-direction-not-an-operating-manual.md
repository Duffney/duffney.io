title: Your future needs a direction, not an operating manual
---

As I sought to redefine my aspirations, I made a critical mistake. I attempted to create a step by step plan that would ensure success. One that would guarantee I’d never fall back into the complacency I had stumbled into. Here’s the thing, it didn’t work. I had over-engineered my own future…

Paralyzed by indecision. I felt stuck. Stuck in the suspended animation of my mind. In motion, but not ever moving. Dreaming but never doing. I was overwhelmed by my thoughts, plans, and intentions. 

I had mapped my career over the next five years and listed out all of my required accomplishments. It was a torture. I had to constantly recalculate whenever circumstances changed or when I changed my mind.

Then I found a cure. It turns out the future needs a direction, not an operating manual. Instead of planning out every single step. I just needed a direction. So I picked a direction and started walking. 

Progress was what I needed. It was a matter of motion vs. action. I overcame it by developing a bias toward action.
