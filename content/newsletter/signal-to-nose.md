**It's better now.** I had a much harsher view of the feed than necessary. 

`0 Following` reminded me of playing a game of kickball as a child. I didn't like the rules so I refused to play. In the end, it only hurt me. I was the one
who wasn't playing. But taking a step back I could observe and understand the rules better. Which is exactly what happened.


**It all came down to the signal to noise ratio**. Having everything in my feed was the problem, not the feed itself. There were certain people I missed hearing from. People who breathe life into the world, inspire, and motivate.
Each tweet they send is worthy of reading. I decided to re-follow all of those people.

I didn't want to abandon those I unfollowed. I followed them for a reason. Many are friends and relationships I cherish. At first, I put everyone into a single list. That resulted in more or less that same problem as before. 

So, I start to categorize the type of information in the list. I found that I follow two communities and one group of amazing technologist who share amazing articles. **I created a list for each.** Now it's much easier to follow along and to join in on conversations. 

TL:DR

- Increase the signal to noise ratio in your feed
- Unfollow but don't unfriend, create lists for like-minded people.

**Next:** _How can I use Twitter like a library instead of a newspaper stand._
