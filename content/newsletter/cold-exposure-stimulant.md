## Reflection

**1**.

Children are not a reason to abandon your dreams. They are the reasons to chase them.

## Action

**1**.

Many months ago I read, “Head Strong: The Bulletproof Plan to Activate Untapped Brain Energy to Work Smarter and Think Faster-in Just Two Weeks” by Dave Asprey. During the two-week program laid out in the book, I tried several things to boost my energy. Cold exposure was a hack that stuck with me.

Beat the 2 pm crash, but not with 5-hour energy shots. Try Ice Face.

I have a tendency to abuse caffeine. Caffeine is a cheap, easy, and enjoyable stimulant but it has its drawbacks. I can handle roughly two cups of coffee well. Anything beyond that and I’ll crash, hard.

I found out dunking my face in ice water to be a feasible alternative!

Use Cold Exposure to Boost Your Energy

Facial Ice Baths

Dunk your face in a bowl filled with ice water for 30-45 secs

Cold Showers

At the end of the shower, turn it to cold for 20-30 secs

Winter Walks

Being ~30 degrees outside where I am, going on a 20 min walk works too.

Until next time,
