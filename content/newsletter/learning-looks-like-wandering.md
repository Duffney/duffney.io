## Reflection

**1**.

Commit then decide. It is by taking action that your next step is revealed. Life doesn't come with GPS, but you do have a compass.

## Quote

**1**.

My interpretation of this is, learn without haste.

Learning new things feels very unproductive. You'll thrash about at the beginning, fumbling around with ideas and techniques. And progress is slow.

Dissolve the outcome and it will become fun and almost playful.

## Action

**1**.

Make weekend phone usage difficult.

I spend on average 10 hours per day in my office and another 45-60 minutes on my cell phone. Using this data as justification, I take the weekends off.

Saturday morning, my cell phone goes into my kitchen drawer. The ringer is on and the volume is set to the highest setting. My only notifications come from texts or phone calls.

Every now and again I'll use it to listen to podcasts or blog posts. When I'm done it goes back in the drawer. My limit is fifteen minutes of unlocked screen time.

Strangely enough, the weekends are when I'm most creative.

Until next time,

Josh Duffney
