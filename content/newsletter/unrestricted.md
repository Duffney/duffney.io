Removing all restraints, I **used Twitter** for **187** minutes. I logged 94 minutes in my web browser. And 93 minutes on my cell phone.

This morning, of course, the first thing I did was check Twitter. Sure enough, I had hits of dopamine waiting for me. **Three hours and seven minutes is excessive usage**. Certainly, nothing I can sustain, but is probably more common than I realize. 

It showed me how much spare time is fragmented throughout the day. I used it in between meetings or between sentences at the dinner table. A habit I have no intention of keeping. I did it to observe when my time is spent on Twitter.

The majority of my time went to three pages; **notifications**, the **"feed"**, and my **profile**.

The `All` tab on the Notifications page is by far the most damaging. It provides a constant stream of dopamine. I found myself retally the total like counts. Worthless. The only thing of value on this page are the notifications of accounts I've subscribed too.

The `Mentions` tab on the other hand is a means of conversation. Sadly, out of the three, it's where I spent the least time. I'd rush through replies to get back to my new notifications.

**There is a reason they call it a feed, it's feeding you.** There's just too much. I just kept scrolling. Paralyzed by choice I rarely contributed. Instead, I meekly like the tweet in my decent down the feed. It adds little value but is the default of my lazy and novice understanding of Twitter.

My `profile`. It's my profile's fault that I don't have 50k followers. So I obsess. Building an audience is a goal of mine, but this obsession must be dealt with.

**Next**: _Refusing to be fed_, getting rid of the feed.
