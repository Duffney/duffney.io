My mind has slipped.

I’m stuck again. Trapped in my mind. Fighting a battle that exists in another’s life. 

I’ve lost my sight. My life plays before my eyes. Yet, I do not see it. I’m elsewhere. Planning, thinking. No, I’m wasting. 

Wasting my time, my talents, and my life. 

It calls me. My slumber awaits. I must reclaim my mind. Rediscover who I am. Who I want to be. 

I compete against myself. And no one else.
