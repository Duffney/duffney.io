**I've become addicted.** Each spare moment pulls me to get that _cheap hit of dopamine_. One like would suffice. But it's the possibility of many that override my willpower.

The only way I know how to get rid of the **low-level anxiety that comes from usage is to not play the game**. It’s not the addiction that keeps me coming back it’s the relationships I’ve built, the people I’ve missed. People who help me navigate the abundance of knowledge.

**Remove Twitter and half or more of my accomplishments vanish.** It provides true tangible value. Even direct monetary value. Twitter accounted for ~25% of all my book sales. Still, this isn’t a cost I’m willing to pay. I’d prefer a happier life. One without the constant nagging that brings on that constant low-level anxiety.

So, over the next 30 days, I’ll be researching, experimenting, and sharing as I learn to use Twitter without getting addicted. **If I fail, my only option is to opt-out of the game.**

**Goals**

* Build a healthy habit of Twitter usage.
* Efficiently use Twitter, maximizing my time to engage with people, build relationships, and seek valuable information.
* Understand the psychology behind Twitter to learn how to avoid or mitigate their mind games.
