The amount of information available is paralyzing.

In 2014 researchers estimated the **storage capacity of the internet at 1 million exabytes**. One exabyte is equal to 1 million terabytes! To put that into perspective, the modern laptop hard drive maxes out at a single terabyte. ðŸ˜±

With so much information available content creators are pushed to pump out more and more content for their chance to go viral.

A well-crafted tweet takes hours, but its average lifetime is 18 minutes.

For that reason, in today's attention economy, it's nearly impossible to maintain a high-quality information diet. Quality has been put aside in favor of volume. You feel the effects of this every time you log into a platform be that Slack, Twitter, or even your email. You're instantly rushed and overwhelmed by information. The signal to noise ratio is extremely low but you can change that.

You have to become intentional about your consumption.

## Reduce the Noise

The digital world is noisy.

You can scroll for hours before you find anything of value. Like a miner sitting at the edge of a stream shifting dirt back and forth in a strainer looking for the tiniest of gold nuggets. Scrolling is inevitable, but at least use the strainer with the smallest holes.

Become sensitive to the quality and relevance of the content you consume.

Unfollow people and unsubcribe from content that is low-quality or irrelevant to your learning.

Being selective isn't selfish. You are giving the creator and the platform your most precious resource, you attention. Use it wisely. Influencers and company accounts won't notice you opting out, but those who you have a personal relationship might. If you value that relationship, inform them your usage of the platform is changing and keep in contact with them through other means.


Turn social platforms into digital libraries.

Envision each login as if you were walking into a bookstore, which sections of the store are you drawn to?

Use that imagery to curate your content into categories. Use the different features of the platform to build your digital bookshelves. Twitter has lists and advanced search, LinkedIn has hashtags, And Reddit has Subreddits.

Time is a vanity metric, everyone has the same amount of time in a day, but not every has the same amount of attention.



## Pull vs Push


Everyone has the same 24 hours in a day, but not everyone has the same amount of attention. Spend it wisely.

Cut out entire platforms. Instagram Facebook

Judge the content by how much value it adds to you. You're giving the creator a sliver of your finite attention, make sure they've earned it. 

A warning, society has began to rely on social media platforms to determine a relationship's health. Influencers might not notice an unfollow, but your college might. Some will 

The easiest way to do that is to cut out the vast majority of noise. 

Become sensitive to the quality and relevance of the content you consume.


Judge them by the stopping power and value add of their content. Your giving them a sliver of your finite attention make sure they've earned it.

Comments

Josh F. : Cool stuff! My first reaction would be things along the lines of: where do you find good and useful information (and conversely, where not); how do you consume it without letting it overwhelm you; brass tacks suggestions for habits / tools / rituals. Looking forward to seeing the results!


Micheal Bender: For me, it would be distilling information down to a manageable and actionable amount for consumption. What strategies will allow you to consume high-quality content without the extra noise.

Ben: I like the direction you're going here, I think that there are a couple different ideas you can address from here:

As a content creator, how do you balance the quality vs quantity for your own content?
It's going to be damn near impossible to have a perfect batting average but at the same time you don't want to put out content solely for the purpose of putting out content... or do you?
How do you refine your feed to focus on quality over quantity?
 Dig into attention economy some more:
What are we sacrificing by always being connected?
Why does social media fight for our attention?
What are some rules/boundaries we can put in place to fight for our attention
Depending on your audience, I think that the second and third bullet points will probably engage the largest audience.  

But personally, I'd be interested in hearing how you choose what/when to make content. I think it's a smaller audience but it would be interesting to have a "behind the scenes" with what your creative process looks like.

Hopefully, that helps! I can't wait for the next essay!


NOTES:

Each cycle beings with an unlock or a new browser tab.

You start by checking notifications because they're simply to difficult to resist. Followed shortly by an instinctual navigation to the feed of a social media platform. 

Boredom has been replaced by a cycle of impulsive checking.

Even without the prompting of a notification you 

Driven by dopamine, the cycle starts with the unlock of your phone. Or the muscle memory that begins to type when you open a new tab in your web browser. Each happens so automatic it seems uncontrollable.

Both are just the beginning of the process. Notifications often prompt the first step but once 

The unlock or new tab is quickly followed by the checking of notifications and invevitably leads to instinctual navigation to the feed of a social media platform. Here you will spend 

You are no longer comfortable with your own thoughts. And because of that each idle moment is a cue

It's something you do, but aren't fully aware of. Next time you get bored, pay close attention to the routine that you mindlessly execute. It starts with the unlock of your phone or the muscle memory that launches your favorite social platform when opening a new tab in a web browser.



Next time you unlock your phone, pay close attention to the pattern you mindlessly follow. It starts with an unlock, then your eyes scan for notification icons. Even one notification is too much to resist so you open the app.

Inside the app, you skim the notifications. Before you've fully read or replied you are drawn to the feed. And the scrolling begins. Several minutes go by and your awareness snaps back. You close the app and move on to the next one with it's irresistible red notification icon staring at you.

I call this routine The "Check-in" cycle.
