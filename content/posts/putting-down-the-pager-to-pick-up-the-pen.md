**After just 6 months**, I left my dream job.

I’m terrified. I’ve spent the last 7 years working to get EXACTLY where I am today.

Many times a voice in my head has screamed:

> “What the #### are you doing?! You love your work, you literally work with the best in your industry, AND AND your manager is Thomas Limoncelli!”

All I can do is a nod to myself and accept that I’m slightly crazy.

I’m not leaving because of anything my dream job lacked. And no, I’m not quitting my 500k job (_I don’t even come close to making that, like at all_) to go independent.

I am, at least in my mind, switching careers.

Today is my first day at **Microsoft** as a **Senior Content Developer**.

_If it doesn’t work out, I pray Stack will take me back. I’ll grovel if I have to. :) I truly loved working there. It’s an amazing company filled with wonderful people._

## Patterns of Fulfillment

After I redefined my career goals, I didn’t stop. I kept digging.

In a Twitter thread titled “[Aimless to an SRE @StackOverflow](https://twitter.com/joshduffney/status/1266343927067574272?s=20)”, I shared my journey of taking back the driver’s seat of my career and landing my dream job, that I just quit, which I feel deserves some explanation.

I began to dig deeper, I started to ask questions of myself beyond my career. I didn’t know what I was looking for, I just kept asking questions. It wasn’t until I asked the question “What do I enjoy the most?”, that a pattern emerged.

Reflecting on a year of tremendous growth for me personally and professionally, I discovered a pattern.

That pattern is:

```
learn > apply > condense > simplify > document > share > teach
```

When I get to complete cycles of this pattern I’m the most fulfilled and happy.

## An Ember that Almost Went Out

I started to explore outlets that allowed me to exercise that pattern.

That entailed writing and narrating blog posts, speaking on podcasts, joining live-streams, presenting at user groups, leading workshops, recording video courses, and writing a book.

I paid very close attention to which activities I enjoyed the most.

What I found surprised me, writing and audio-only podcasts were what I enjoyed the most. Podcasts made sense because they are essentially conversations on a topic of interest to me. Writing surprised me and everyone around me.

Once I started, I couldn’t put it down.

In _two_ days I have been writing every morning for **300** consecutive days.

## Jobs, Careers, and Callings

I’ve called being an SRE [@StackOverflow](https://twitter.com/StackOverflow) my dream job many times, I’m not lying.

It was a dream I created for myself. I can trace it all the way back to my [Doubling My Salary a PowerShell Story](https://duffney.io/doubling-my-salary-a-powershell-story/) blog post. Drawing from others in the industry, I built my dream and achieved it. I escaped the job and forged a career.

What’s drawn me away from my own dream is the possibility of a calling.

I’ve been writing as an amateur since the beginning of my career. It started with writing how-tos on Spiceworks, which turned into a blog, and most recently a self-published book.

Looking back, writing has always been there. I’ve written sporadically for nearly a decade on the side, never taking it seriously. Maybe I was just running from it.

## A Common Thread

A single thing connects the transition of a job into a career and a career into a calling.

That common thread is PowerShell.

I now have the opportunity to contribute to this community on a massive scale. My blog just became docs.microsoft.com and I get to write there full time! Perhaps one day my name will be worthy alongside (or slightly below) these gentlemen.

## What’s Next, Turning Pro

I’m going all in!

**Today is the day I set my sights on becoming a professional writer.**

I have a ton to learn and don’t know even know what success looks like.

The only thing I am certain about is, it’s time to get to **work**!

Instead of focusing on outcomes, I’m focusing on outputs.

**My [PACTs](https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact) (Purposeful, Actionable, Continuous, and Trackable)**

- Publish _30_ newsletters over the next _30_ weeks
- Publish _6_ freelance articles over the next _6_ months
- Write _100_ pages of a self-published ebook over the next _6_ months

There are two types of stories.

Stories that have a complete narrative. And stories that have just begun. Ones that invite you along the journey.

That’s the invitation I’m extending to you, this story is just beginning.
