## Hi, I'm Josh Duffney

Welcome to my blog. I [write](/posts), [teach](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/josh-duffney), and [tweet](https://twitter.com/joshduffney) about; _Technology, Self-improvement, and Digital Fitness._

At my day job, Iâ€™m a **Senior Content Developer** [@Microsoft](https://twitter.com/Microsoft) where I write a cache for [PowerShell](/tags/powershell/), [Ansible](/tags/ansible), [Terraform](/tags/terraform), [DevOps](/tags/devops), and [Azure](/tags/azure) on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/). I've documented my decade long career in a series of blog posts. Sharing both my professional and personal journey.

Technology has given me a career, not a job. I love what I do, but there's a catch.

It's nearly impossible to avoid the clutches of an always-on, always-connected mentality. With an infinite number of things to learn in tech. And equally infinite number of ways to stay connected, it's easy to stare at a screen for endless hours a day.

Falling prey to that mentality has led me to burnout.

To combat it, I focus on deep, meaningful work and practice digital minimalism in order to [detach from distraction](/detaching-from-distraction) and live a life empowered by technology [not consumed](/the-digital-declutter) by it.

Your [attention](https://duffney.io/attention-matters-more-than-time/) is your most valuable resource, [reclaim](https://duffney.io/reclaim/) it.
